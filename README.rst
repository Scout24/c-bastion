About
=====

``c-bastion`` allows you to create users in a docker container via a CLI tool
and then log in with these formerly created users. The CLI tool is called
``cbas`` and can be found at:

https://github.com/immobilienscout24/cbas

The purpose of this project is to provide an EC2 instance with a Docker
container that can be used as a jump-host with dynamically created user. After
creation, the user is able to log in into the Docker container by using his/her
given SSH key.

The basic flow is as follows::

    +-----------------+  +-----------------+  +-----------------+
    |                 |  |                 |  |                 |
    |    developer    |  |    jump host    |  |   auth server   |
    |                 |  |                 |  |                 |
    +--------+--------+  +--------+--------+  +--------+--------+
             |                    |                    |
             +----------------------------------------->
             | request token      |                    |
             <-----------------------------------------+
             | receive token      |                    |
             |                    |                    |
             +-------------------->                    |
             | upload key         +-------------------->
             |                    | validate token     |
             |                    <--------------------+
             <--------------------+                    |
             | upload OK          |                    |
             |                    |                    |
             +-------------------->                    |
             | ssh log in         |                    |
             |                    |                    |
             |                    |                    |
             |                    |                    |
             +                    +                    +

Where ``developer`` is your local machine (desktop, laptop, etc..) ``auth
server`` is the auth-server and ``jump host`` is the jump host. ``cbas`` takes
care of obtaining the token and uploading the ssh-key.

Features
========

The bastion host is a slim Ubuntu and contains the following extra features:

* `vim-nox`_
* `screen`_ and `tmux`_
* `zsh`_
* python with `pip`_ and `virtualenv`_
* Import `your Personal Environment via SSH`__

Architecture
============

The main server-code is written Python and everything is packaged as a Docker
container. Inside the Docker container we use
`Supervisor <http://supervisord.org/>`_ to run multiple processes. You may
inspect the file ``supervisord.conf`` to see the how it has been configured
(and where the log files are).

Configuration
=============

To run the jump-host you will need a so called auth-server that can provide
`OpenID Connect <http://openid.net/connect/>`_
`Json Web Tokens <http://jwt.io/>`_. To configure this server, please supply
the URL via an environment variable called ``AUTH_URL``. Note, that is
configured as a full url *including* the protocol and *without* a trailing
slash, e.g. ``http://auth-server.example``.

Docker Image Availability
=========================

The project is built with continuous integration on `Travis CI
<https://travis-ci.org/>`_.  This tests the server code, builds the Docker
image and uploads it to `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_ via Travis.
Hence you may obtain the Docker image from our organization on Docker Hub:

https://hub.docker.com/r/immobilienscout24/c-bastion/


Deployment
==========

Personally, we use `AWS CloudFormation
<https://aws.amazon.com/de/cloudformation/>`_ in conjunction with `(our own
custom version of ) Stups Taupage
<http://stups.readthedocs.org/en/latest/components/taupage.html>`_ to deploy.
Your milage may vary. Unfortuntaley the templates we use contain private
configuartion so we are unable to make those available to the public.

API
===

There are a total of three endpoints:

:``status``: Check if the server is up and running.
:``create``: Upload ssh-key-file and create user.
:``version``: Report the version as JSON.

Note however, that the preferred way to interact with the server is ``cbas``.

Local Testing
=============

Pull the image from Docker Hub:

.. code-block::

    $ docker pull immobilienscout24/c-bastion

You can then launch the Docker image using, note how the ``AUTH_URL`` is
supplied:

.. code-block::

    $ docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -e AUTH_URL=http://auth-server.example immobilienscout24/c-bastion:latest

And finally, check that the container has started and that the jump-host server
has come up:

.. code-block::

   $ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/status
   OK

You could also check the current version:

.. code-block::

   $ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/version
   {'version': '53'}

Development
===========

The project is written in Python 2.7 and uses PyBuilder build and test tool.

#. You should always build and test within a virtual-environment, that contains
   an up-to-date `pip` and `pybuilder`:

   .. code-block::

       $ virtualenv venv
       $ source venv/bin/activate
       (venv) $ pip install -U pip
       (venv) $ pip install pybuilder
       (venv) $ pyb install_dependencies

#. To run just the unit-tests, static code analysis and coverage reporting:

   .. code-block::

       (venv) $ pyb
       ...

#. To build the Docker image:

   .. code-block::

       (venv) $ pyb docker_build

#. To system-test the Docker image:

   .. code-block::

       (venv) $ pyb system_test

#. To build and run all available tests, simply type:

   .. code-block::

       (venv) $ pyb all
